URL-Based Rules
Rule Condition Why it works
Length Check len(url) > 75 Phishing URLs are often long to hide malicious paths.
IP Address in URL http://192.168... Attackers use raw IPs to avoid domain registration.
Multiple subdomains count('.') > 3 Phishers use fake subdomains to mimic trusted domains.
“@” symbol @ in URL Redirects to another URL, often used in phishing.
HTTPS missing No https:// Lack of SSL is suspicious for login forms.
Suspicious keywords login, secure, banking, etc. Often used in phishing to gain trust.
URL shortening bit.ly, tinyurl Used to hide real URL
Email-Based Rules
Rule Condition Why it works
Spoofed sender From = CEO@company.com, but IP not matching domain Used in BEC (Business Email Compromise).
Generic greeting “Dear user” or “Dear customer” Phishers don't know your name.
Urgency tone “Immediate action required” Pressure tactics = phishing.
Suspicious attachments .exe, .html, .js files High-risk for malware/phishing.
Mismatched domain Display name ≠ actual email Email impersonation technique.
Website Content-Based Rules
Rule Condition Why it works
No favicon Missing favicon.ico Legit sites almost always have one.
Form action is blank <form action=""> Captures your input without actual submission.
External form handler <form action="http://phisher.com"> Redirects data to attacker.
Obfuscated JavaScript eval(), document.write() used Often used to hide malicious code.
Clickjacking elements Invisible iframes Common in credential theft.
SSL Certificate-Based Rules
Rule Condition Why it works
Self-signed cert Issuer = same as subject Not trusted.
Expired cert expiry_date < today Likely not maintained.
Mismatched CN/SAN Domain doesn’t match certificate Fake or stolen cert.
work on the bases of these rules detection perform.
