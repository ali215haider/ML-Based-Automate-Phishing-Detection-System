Step 1: Project Setup
Folder Structure: Ensure your folder structure is organized as you have outlined. This will help maintain clarity and ease of navigation throughout the project.
Environment Setup:
Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
Install necessary libraries using requirements.txt. Common libraries include Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, scikit-learn, pandas, etc.
Step 2: Define Project Requirements
Functional Requirements:
User registration and login.
URL, email, and HTML file scanning.
Real-time classification of phishing attempts.
Reporting and educational features.
Non-Functional Requirements:
User-friendly interface.
Fast response times for scanning.
Secure handling of user data.
Step 3: Develop the Backend
Flask Application:

Set up the Flask application in app/__init__.py.
Configure the app with necessary settings (database, secret keys, etc.).
Database Models:

Define SQLAlchemy models in app/models/ for users, scan history, and reports.
Implement database migrations if necessary.
Routes and Logic:

Create routes in app/routes/ for handling user authentication, scanning URLs, emails, and HTML files.
Implement the logic for each route, ensuring to handle inputs and outputs correctly.
Detection Logic:

In app/utils/, implement the core detection logic:
Feature Extraction: Extract features from URLs, emails, and HTML files.
Blacklist Checking: Implement logic to check against a blacklist.
Heuristic Rules: Define rules for detecting phishing attempts.
ML Prediction: Load and use the ML model for predictions.
Step 4: Develop the Frontend
HTML Templates:

Create attractive and responsive HTML templates in app/templates/.
Use CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
User Interface:

Ensure the UI is intuitive. Use clear labels, buttons, and feedback messages.
Implement forms for user input (e.g., scanning URLs, reporting phishing).
Real-Time Feedback:

Use AJAX or Fetch API to provide real-time feedback on scans without refreshing the page.
Step 5: Implement User Authentication
Use Flask-Login for user authentication.
Create routes for registration, login, and profile management.
Ensure user sessions are handled securely.
Step 6: Educational and Reporting Features
Develop an educational section with tips on identifying phishing attempts.
Implement a reporting form for users to report suspicious sites.
Track submitted reports and display them in the user profile.
Step 7: Browser Extension Development
Create a simple Chrome extension in the extensions/ folder.
Use JavaScript to capture visited URLs and send them to the Flask server for scanning.
Display alerts based on the server's response.
Step 8: Testing and Debugging
Unit Testing: Write tests for your functions and routes to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Testing: Test the entire application flow from user registration to scanning and reporting.
User Testing: Gather feedback from potential users to identify areas for improvement.
Step 9: Documentation
Write clear documentation in README.md explaining how to set up and use the project.
Include instructions for running the application, using the features, and contributing to the project.
Step 10: Final Touches
UI/UX Enhancements: Polish the user interface, ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for speed and efficiency.
Deployment: Consider deploying the application on a platform like Heroku or AWS for public access.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive and professional Automate Phishing Detection System. Focus on each component, ensuring quality and usability. Good luck with your final year project!
